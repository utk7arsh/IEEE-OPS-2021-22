# IEEE-OPS-2021-22
Dump of my projects in the IEEE branch at UCLA's Open Project Space program

I have included 4 of the 7 projects done in this program. 
1. Autoflashlight - A simple IR commanded flash using Arduino Nano and 555 timer which turns on and off based on the photosensor reading on the crucit
2. Ipoduino - Part of the Ipoduino contest which used three buttons to develop a sound producing circuit using pulse width modulation. The contest eradicated the buttons to create a sound on our own using pitches. 
3. IR distance sensor - Another basic IR emittor circuit which detected distance of the obstacle using the signal detection of the bounced back emmission. Was later used in my line following robot project to create a sensor other the already existing one on the car. 
4. GameBuino - A joystick video game programmed from scratch to play TicTacToe. The project used OLED display and the object was to setup the circuit and program a game of our choice. Adafruit lilbrary proved to be a helpful resource in the game development.
